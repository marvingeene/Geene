# GeenesPythonStuff
A couply of small mediocre python tkinter programs.
These aren't very good, and probably definetly not pythonic

------------- Fire Emblem Ironman Display (FEID) ----------

Intended as a streaming utility to make displaying character deaths during ironman playthroughs easier.

Allows the user to add the characters, with a name and a path to a picture.

------------- Pokemon Team Visualiser (PTV) ----------

Intended as a streaming utility to make displaying character deaths during pokemon nuzlokes / soullinks easier.

Allows the user to either add a single pokemon, or a pair of pokemon, swap them between the team, the box and the graveyard, change images.


------------- Calendar Generator (CG) ----------

Converts a text file with entries in the following format (name dd.mm), into a compact excel file.
Reads from a file called "geburtstage.txt", and also currently uses the german month names.




# TODO 
PTV & FEID: 

Allow the user to set a background image instead of a background color.

Add an option that each picture has the corresponding name displayed below it.

Improve calculation of correct size, it sometimes behaves weirdly.

(PTV) Change kill pokemon method to make switching the picture to pained optional.


CG :
Allow the user to select the file that the dates are read from.
Allow the user to choose between german and english.
Do a check so that the date can be entered in both dd.mm and mm.dd
