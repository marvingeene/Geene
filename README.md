These aren't very good, and probably definetly not pythonic

------------- Fire Emblem Ironman Display (FEID) ----------

Intended as a streaming utility to make displaying character deaths during ironman playthroughs easier.

Allows the user to add the characters, with a name and a path to a picture.

------------- Pokemon Team Visualiser (PTV) ----------

Intended as a streaming utility to make displaying character deaths during pokemon nuzlokes / soullinks easier.

Allows the user to either add a single pokemon, or a pair of pokemon, swap them between the team, the box and the graveyard, change images.


------------- Calendar Generator (CG) ----------

Converts a text file with entries in the following format (name dd.mm), into a compact excel file.




# TODO 
PTV & FEID: 

Allow the user to set a background image instead of a background color.

CG :

Nothing really, this was made for a very specific purpose and it works for that, so nothing really to do, maybe do a check so that the date can be entered in both dd.mm and mm.dd
